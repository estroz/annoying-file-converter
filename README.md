# Simple bash script for automating image file to pdf file conversion

Although this task could be done by hand, I would rather just automate it. I als found this a fun exercise for bash scripting, albiet simple. 

Note: uses `convert` command by imagemagick to do the actual conversion, all I did was add recursive automation and file finding
